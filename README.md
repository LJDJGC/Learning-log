Topic: DOM Manipulation and Events with The Odin Project

- Types of web page manipulation possible with JavaScript
- Realization: Previously, I had an item that I couldn't click on in Python, so I automated the process using JavaScript web page manipulation code, and now I've created something a little familiar.
- Next up: Tonight, I'll continue studying Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors.

Clarified the difference between event listeners and event handlers.

Understood why textContent is safer and clearer than innerHTML for adding plain text.

Realized that combining DOM manipulation with events is the foundation of making interactive web pages.

What I Did Today

Learning Topic: DOM Manipulation and Event Handling

Based on the "shopping-list.html" starter file, I prepared a state with minimal CSS, labels, input fields, a button, and an empty <ul>.

Stored references to <ul>, <input>, and <button> in variables.

Created a function called handleClick that executes when the button is clicked.

Retrieved the value of the input element and saved it in a variable.

Empty the input field.

Created three new elements: <li>, <span>, and <button>.

Displayed the input value in the <span> and added a delete label to the <button>.

Added a <span> and <button> to the <li> and appended them to the <ul>.

What I Learned

The importance of using document.querySelector to retrieve HTML elements and store them in variables.

createElement and appendChild How to dynamically add elements using CSS.

Using an event listener to execute a function when a button is clicked

Creating a new element within a function allows you to generate a separate <li> element for each click.

Next steps

Add a click event to the added delete button to delete the list item.

Practice applying dynamic styles using CSS classes.
