Today I Learned (TIL)

Today, on NeetCode, I worked on the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem, which is about maximizing profit by determining the ideal time to buy at a minimum price and sell at a maximum price. This exercise made me realize that in real-life situations, where the future is unknown, it is essential to set a minimum criterion (or threshold/strategy) for decision-making.

My current study plan is to read and fully understand the explanation, then manually write the code myself, create an Anki card based on it, and later use active recall to ensure long-term memory retention.
