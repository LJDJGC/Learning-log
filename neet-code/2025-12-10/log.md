📝 Today I Learned (TIL)
Topic: Algorithms (NeetCode - Trapping Rain Water)
Today, I worked on the Trapping Rain Water problem from NeetCode. I was able to follow the explanation and grasp the overall logic from the solution video. However, when looking at the actual solution code, I struggled to clearly map which lines or sections corresponded to which part of the conceptual understanding.

Instead of trying to achieve complete mastery today, I've decided to shift my approach. I will create Anki flashcards for this problem to utilize Spaced Repetition and Active Recall for review. I believe this learning method will be more effective for truly internalizing the algorithm and improving my algorithmic problem-solving skills over time.

It was a difficult session, but a valuable lesson in structured learning.
