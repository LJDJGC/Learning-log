📝 Today I Learned (TIL)
Topic: The Odin Project - Intermediate HTML and CSS (Advanced Selectors)
Today, I continued reading Shay Howe’s article on Complex Selectors as part of The Odin Project's Advanced Selectors section in the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.

To enhance my learning, I practiced in Codepen and manually verified which elements each selector was targeting. This active output method significantly boosted my learning efficiency.

I also moved on to the Selectors Assessment from MDN. While my overall learning speed has slowed down, I feel that actively coding and performing self-checks is greatly improving my understanding. I realize that my study efficiency is still not fully maximized, so I plan to continue searching for better methods while utilizing Anki and Active Recall to ensure better knowledge retention.
